Q1: Use CHOOSE() and MONTH() to get the season in which each order was shipped from the Orders
table. You should select the order ID, shipped date, and then the season aliased as ShippedSeason. 
You can copy and paste the below into your query.

<pre><b>SELECT OrderID, ShippedDate, CHOOSE(MONTH(ShippedDate), 'Winter', 'Winter', 
'Spring', 'Spring', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Summer', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Autumn',
'Autumn', 'Winter') AS ShippedSeason 
FROM dbo.Orders WHERE ShippedDate IS NOT NULL
</b></pre>

Q2: Using the Suppliers table, select the company name and use a simple IIF expression to 
display 'outdated' if a company has a fax number, or 'modern' if it doesn't. 
Alias the result of the IIF expression to Status

<pre><b>SELECT CompanyName,
IIF(Fax is NULL, 'modern', 'outdated') AS Status
FROM dbo.Suppliers
</b></pre>

Q3: Select from the Customers, Orders, and Order Details tables. Note that you 
need to use [Order Details] since the table name contains whitespace.

Use GROUP BY and ROLLUP() to get the total quantity ordered by all countries, while 
maintaining the total per country in your result set.

Your first column should be the country, and the second column the total quantity ordered
by that country, aliased as TotalQuantity.

<pre><b>SELECT c.Country, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity 
FROM dbo.Customers AS c
INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS o
ON c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID
INNER JOIN [Order Details] AS od
on od.OrderId=o.OrderID
GROUP BY Country WITH ROLLUP
</b></pre>

Q4: From the Customers table, use GROUP BY to select the 
country, contact title, and count of that contact title aliased
as Count, grouped by country and contact title (in that order).

Then use CASE WHEN, GROUPING_ID(), and ROLLUP() to add a column
called Legend, which shows one of two things:

-When the GROUPING_ID is 0, show '' (i.e., nothing)
-When the GROUPING_ID is 1, show Subtotal for << Country >>'

<pre><b>SELECT Country, ContactTitle, COUNT(*) AS Count,
(CASE
WHEN GROUPING_ID(Country, ContactTitle) = 1
THEN CONCAT('Subtotal for ',Country)
WHEN GROUPING_ID(Country, ContactTitle) = 0
THEN ''
  END) AS Legend
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country, ContactTitle WITH ROLLUP;
</b></pre>

Q5: Convert the following query to be pivoted, using PIVOT().
SELECT CategoryID, AVG(UnitPrice)
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;

<pre><b>SELECT * FROM
(SELECT CategoryID, UnitPrice
FROM dbo.Products) AS Sales
PIVOT(AVG(UnitPrice) 
FOR CategoryID in([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8])) AS [Per Category]
</b></pre>

Q6: Insert into the Region table the region ID 5 and the description 'Space'.
Then, in a second query, select the newly inserted data from the table using a WHERE clause.
<pre><b>INSERT INTO dbo.Region VALUES(5, 'Space')
SELECT RegionID, RegionDescription FROM dbo.Region
WHERE RegionID=5
</b></pre>

Q7: Update the region descriptions in the Region table to be all uppercase, using SET and UPPER().
Next, select all data from the table to view your updates.

<pre><b>UPDATE dbo.Region 
SET RegionDescription =UPPER(RegionDescription)
SELECT * 
FROM dbo.Region
</b></pre>

Q8 Write a script that safely checks whether a certain region exists:
Declare a custom region @region called Space, of type NVARCHAR(25). Use IF NOT EXISTS, ELSE, and BEGIN..END to:
throw an error with THROW 50001, 'Error!', 0 if no record whose RegionDescription matches @region exists. select all columns for 
that region from the Region table if the record does exist. Notes:
Specify the Region table as Region, not dbo.Region. Use SELECT * FROM Region <fill in> everywhere

<pre><b>UPDATE dbo.Region 
SET RegionDescription =UPPER(RegionDescription)
SELECT * 
FROM dbo.Region
</b></pre>
